Welcome! I've created this space to share with you my conversations, experiences, and my love for learning of difference cultures. My goal is to fully immerse you and essentially have you feeling like you're right along side me on my journeys, sharing each of your 5 senses (maybe a 6th!) of and given moment. I've had a lot of very interesting opportunities in my life. In the end, I decided I never felt truly fulfilled, finding my deepest connection rooted in learning of other cultures, primarily their music. As a pianist with an education in the recording arts field, I can proudly say, I can't wait to explore with you. I've learned that there aren't many ways of communicating universally, translation apps and charades aside. While those tools are undoubtedly helpful -thank you, creators!- music has remained the leader in conveying heart, mind, history and story telling, and collaboration, between complete strangers to create something truly unique and yet all so familiar. We're going to look at the meaning behind it, the instruments, the people, and how these sounds are reflected in their everyday living; from nature, to food, to art. Always a very independent person, known to escape on an adventure at any given moment or be daydreaming of the next, this "wayward child" is happy to bring you along as her travel buddy into world music. Come wander with me.</p>
